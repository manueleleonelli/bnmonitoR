# bnmonitor

`bnmonitor` is a package for sensitivity analysis and robustness in Bayesian networks.

## Installation 

The package `bnmonitor` can be installed from GitHub using the command 
```{r eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("manueleleonelli/bnmonitor")
```
and loaded in R with
```{r}
library(bnmonitor)
```
Note that `bnmonitor` requires the package `gRain` which, while on CRAN, depends on packages that are on Bioconductor both directly and through the `gRbase` package, which depends on `RBGL`:
```{r eval =F}
BiocManager::install()
BiocManager::install(c("graph", "Rgraphviz", "RBGL"))
install.packages("gRain")
```
